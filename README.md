# Web scraping

Web scraping code for the [getty images](https://www.gettyimages.com.br/) site. Works for any relative URL that can be found on the site. Just change the base/relative URL in the code and execute the cells sequentially. At the end of the notebook, you can find the piece of code that can be used to download images into your computer. You can also filter the photos by single classes, like "woman", "man", and so on.

For more details, check out the notebook comments.
